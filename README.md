# MST

Minimum Spanning Tree

A partial spanning tree is a tree that spans only a subset of a graph (only some of the vertices in the graph are connected by the partial tree). In Tarjan and Cheriton's round-robin algorithm, partial trees are built and combined until only one remains: the MST of the entire graph.
